# RealTime_Twitter_WordCloud

The idea is to collect words and their frequency from real time twitter using Java and its libraries, then generate word could using Javascript and d3.js, and finally using nood.js or its express frameword to host.

-	First, input key words to search on twitter
1.	Navigate to \myapp\public\Tweets_for_js folder
2.	Open CliendCode.java, input key words to search on Twitter in editor, for example – {“donald”, “trump”}
3.	Run the file

- Second, click html and see the effects

The project is also hosted by Node.js and Express localhost.
